It is now possible to create a DevGames account with our Discord bot!

## How do I create an account?
1. Go to the #sierra channel, type /register and enter your email address. After that, send the command and the bot will send a message like this

2. If you get a message like the picture, you need to verify. To do this type /verify and in the form enter your email address (your one-time password is linked to the email so it won't work without it), a username and the OTP and verify yourself.
